# climate-emergency-declarations

This project is no longer under active development. It was built for a site intended to augment the [ICEF spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tb-LklFWLujYnjmCSvCWRcLUJCCWAL27dKPzVcFq9CQ) tracking governments around the world which have recognised or declared a climate emergency.

It used Django with PostgreSQL to build a database that was manually edited and maintained by volunteers.


## Using the inbox

The inbox acts as a staging area for declaration data from the ICEF spreadsheet. It currently consists of a list of inbox items and a text area to create new items.

The list is shown on various pages that can be used as reference or can be selected from to create new areas and declarations. To create a new area from the inbox, select an inbox item by clicking on it then click any 'add from inbox' admin link and a new area and declaration will be added with the information in the inbox item. To add a declaration to an existing area from the inbox, select an inbox item then click any 'declare from inbox' admin link and a new declaration will be created with the information in the inbox item.

The current method for creating new inbox items is via the inbox paste area. It allows for multiple rows to be copied from the ICEF spreadsheet Data page and pasted into a csv format in the text field. The text can then be submitted by pressing the 'create' button.

The inbox system will later include a form for inbox item creation to allow for the creation of new inbox items individually.

## Running for local development and testing

When running in production, all environment variables set in `docker-compose.yml` are provided separately with secret managed values. For running a local dev copy, using the environment variables hardcoded into `docker-compose.yml` is fine. You can of course edit the environment variables if you prefer, just make sure they are consistent between the `db` and `web` services.

### Installation

The site can be run locally using Docker and Docker Compose. This will bring up two containers: a Postgres container for the database, and a Django container for the webserver. Here are the steps:

* Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Clone this repository to your local system
* From the root directory of this repo, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up`
* You should now be able to access the site in a browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/cegov/
* The code running within the web container is mapped from the local repo, so you can make changes to the code or templates and see them take effect immediately in the local site.

### Loading initial data

Run `bin/web-shell.sh` to open a shell in the web container. You can now interact with the Django `manage.py` script, e.g. `python manage.py check`

Load seed data into the database by running the following commands in the web container:
 * `python manage.py loaddata countries`
 * `python manage.py loaddata structures`
 * `python manage.py loaddata areas`

The "countries list" on your local site should now be populated.

Create an admin login with this command: `python manage.py createsuperuser`

Set a username and password here, then you can use these credentials to log in to the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/b72c0824/

Run `bin/db-shell.sh` to open a `psql` session to the local database.

### Testing

When docker-compose has both containers running, you can execute tests either from a shell in the web container: `python manage.py test`

or from a terminal on your local system, in the root directory of the repository: `./bin/run-container-test.sh`

Either way, this executes the Django test suite.
